## INSTALLATION

### Step 1: Preparation

1) Back up your project - We strongly recommend using version control (e.g. Git)

2) Download and extract the plugin zip file into your project's /addons directory. This is what the folder structure should look like:

📁 your-project
  └─ 📁 addons
      └─ 📁 gamedev_assistant --> plugin.gd should be found here

You can delete the zip file and this text file after extraction.

3) In Godot, go to Project → Project Settings → Plugins tab

4) Enable the "GameDev Assistant" plugin

5) Restart the editor: Project → Reload Current Project

6) Locate the new Assistant tab in the editor (found in the same panel area as Inspector and Node - you may need to click the panel arrows "< >" to reveal it)

7) Enter your API key

8) Click the + button to start your first chat


## UPGRADING THE PLUGIN TO NEW VERSIONS

1) Close Godot Editor completely

2) Back up your project if you haven't already

3) Delete the folder /addons/gamedev_assistant

4) Download and extract the new plugin version to your project's /addons directory

Correct folder structure:

📁 your-project
  └─ 📁 addons
      └─ 📁 gamedev_assistant --> plugin.gd should be found here

5) Open Godot Editor

The plugin will automatically be enabled as your previous settings are preserved
